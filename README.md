# CS15
Projects from CS15: Data Structures at Tufts University. 

Projects include: 
- Implementing a working Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator
- Implementing a program to simulate a running train that can accommodate Passengers arriving/departing the metro to and from a series of stations based on a set of given command. Done is using an implementation of a queue.
-  Coding BFS and DFS
-  Project 2: Simulates the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon; however, instead of actors, the program uses musical artists and songs they have collaborated on with other artists. The program interactively accepts queries in the form of an input command and the names of artists. It then outputs a path to get from the first artist to the second via musical collaborations (with some restrictions depending on the input command). 

Topics include:
- Array Lists
- Linked Lists
- Trees (specifically binary search trees)
- Graphs (BFS and DFS)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables (though no project on hash tables was assigned in the course)
