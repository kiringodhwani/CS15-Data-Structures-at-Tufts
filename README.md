# CS15
Projects from CS15: Data Structures at Tufts University. 

Projects include: 
- Implementing a working Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator
- Implementing a program to simulate a running train that can accommodate Passengers arriving/departing the metro to and from a series of stations based on a set of given command. Done is using an implementation of a queue.
- Project 1: Implements a working Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator. RPN is also known as “postfix” notation. The calculator can handle various commands and operations such as arithmetic operations like addition and division, boolean operations with operators like ==, >, and <=, as well as commands that allow the user to operate the calculator and create different operations (e.g. adding integers, duplicating, swapping, dropping, clearing the calculator, etc.). The calculator can also execute inputted rstrings and read in input from a commands file. Implemented using 
-  Project 2: Simulates the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon; however, instead of actors, the program uses musical artists and songs they have collaborated on with other artists. The program interactively accepts queries in the form of an input command and the names of artists. It then outputs a path to get from the first artist to the second via musical collaborations (with some restrictions depending on the input command). Implemented using a graph data structure and BFS and DFS.

Topics include:
- Array Lists
- Linked Lists
- Trees (specifically binary search trees)
- Graphs (BFS and DFS)
- Stacks and Queues
- Hash Tables (though no project on hash tables was assigned in the course)
